My AI Usage
AI Tools Used

ChatGPT (OpenAI)

How I Used AI

I used ChatGPT as a learning and problem-solving companion throughout this project.

Debugging help: Whenever I got stuck with errors (TypeScript issues, MongoDB queries, JWT authentication problems, or API failures), I used ChatGPT to understand why the error was happening and how to fix it.

Backend development: ChatGPT helped me think through the structure of Express controllers, middleware, and role-based access (user vs admin). I still wrote and adjusted the code myself after understanding the suggestions.

Frontend integration: I used ChatGPT to debug React + TypeScript issues such as Axios setup, handling JWT tokens, protected routes, and state updates after API calls.


Testing support: ChatGPT guided me on how to structure Jest and Supertest tests properly, especially around beforeAll / afterAll, database cleanup, and fixing async test failures.

Git & workflow issues: I used ChatGPT to solve Git and GitHub problems like authentication errors, branch setup, and pushing the project correctly to a public repository.

Documentation: ChatGPT helped me organize and polish the README so it clearly explains the project, setup steps, and AI usage in a professional way.
